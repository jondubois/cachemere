Feel free to add new items to this list.

- Add a middleware function in the form middleware(err, req, res, next) 
so that Cachemere can be directly used as express middleware.

- Benchmark cachemere performance. It would be interesting to see how many requests
it can handle per second on standard hardware.
Add results to the end of the README file.

- Add some tests (create a new tests/ directory).
